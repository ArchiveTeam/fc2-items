How to Retrieve URL

1. Search Pages
To retrieve search results, send a GET request with all parameters included in the URL's query string.
Search results are displayed 10 per page.

Example URL Structure:
[Search Page URL]?searchstring=&categoryid=all&action=searchengine&subaction=search&startindex=0

To paginate through the results, increment the startindex parameter by 10 for each subsequent request (e.g., 0, 10, 20, ...).
The advantage of this method is that it allows you to archive each search results page individually.

2. Category Pages
To access items by category, send a GET request to the following URL structure, where the categoryid can be all or a number from 1 to 25.
[Search Page URL]?action=searchengine&subaction=viewcategory&categoryid={ID}
Pagination for categories also uses the startindex parameter, but it begins at 1. Since a maximum of 20 items are displayed per category, the only values you will need are startindex=1 for the first page and startindex=11 for the second.

3. Ranking Pages
The Ranking Page contains a complete list of links to the daily, weekly, monthly, and total rankings for every category on the site.
By accessing all of these links, you can retrieve the URLs for the individual websites listed in the rankings.
The content of a ranking page is determined by its numeric path ID (e.g., /003/, /004/), not the domain name.
For example, the same content will be displayed whether you use `fc2web.com` or `gooside.com`, as long as the ID in the path is the same.  
If a ranking page was inaccessible on a specific domain, it has been replaced with a working alternative using `fc2web.com`.

4. Summary
The three approaches described above should be sufficient to collect the vast majority of URLs.

Regarding the URL formats, all variations link to the same page.
For example:
http://canan.fc2web.com/ and http://canan.sugoihp.com/ both link to the same page.
Similarly, http://bouringu.finito.fc2.com/, http://bouringu.finito-web.com/, and http://finito-web.com/bouringu all display the same content when accessed.
